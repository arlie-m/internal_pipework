## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Set the directory containing the sequence files
dir <- here::here("data", "renamed_sequences")

# Get a list of all files in the directory
files <- list.files(dir, pattern = "\\.ab1$", full.names = TRUE)

# Create a vector to store the file names with suffixes
file_names <- character(length(files))

# Process each file and create a SangerRead object
sanger_reads <- lapply(files, function(file) {
  if (grepl("_F\\.ab1$", file)) {
    read_type <- "Forward Read"
  } else {
    read_type <- "Reverse Read"
  }
  
  SangerRead(
    readFeature = read_type,
    readFileName = file,
    geneticCode = GENETIC_CODE,
    TrimmingMethod = "M2",
    M1TrimmingCutoff = NULL,
    M2CutoffQualityScore = 20,
    M2SlidingWindowSize = 10,
    baseNumPerRow = 100,
    heightPerRow = 200,
    signalRatioCutoff = 0.33,
    showTrimmed = TRUE
  )
})
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
lapply(sanger_reads, qualityBasePlot)
lapply(sanger_reads, writeFastaSR, outputDir = here::here("outputs", "renamed_sequences_fasta"))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

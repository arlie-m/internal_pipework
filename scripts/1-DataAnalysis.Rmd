# Code Setup and Data Import

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(vegan)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```

I have one data file with the count data from lab processing. The file needs some wrangling to calculate a density (counts per cm2) for each quadrat sampled.

```{r}
taxon_count_data <- read_csv("data/taxon_count_data_internal_pipework.csv")
taxon_density <- taxon_count_data %>% 
  group_by(sample_id, taxon, taxon_grouping_qualifier) %>% 
  mutate(density = count*multiply_by/divide_by/area_sampled*100) %>% #counts per m2
  summarise(avg_density = mean(density))
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
